## Requirements
- Functions communicate using input parameter(s) and the return statement.
- Use a `list`, `tuple` or `dictionary` tu represent each complex number (e.g. 1-2i as `[1, -2]`, `(1, -2)` or `{'real': 1, 'imag': -2}` respectively). To access or modify numbers, use `getter` and `setter` functions.
- Separate input/output functions (those using `print` and `input` statements) from those performing the calculations.
- Provide the user with a menu-driven console-based user interface. Input data should be read from the console and the results printed to the console. At each step, the program must provide the user the context of the operation (do not display an empty prompt).

## Problem Statement
Implement a menu-driven console application that provides the following functionalities:
1. Read a list of complex numbers (in `z = a + bi` form) from the console.
2. Display the entire list of numbers on the console.
3. Display on the console the longest sequence that observes a given property.
4. Exit the application.

### Sequence Properties
The sequence (consists of):
1. Numbers having the same modulus.
2. Real numbers.

**The source code will include:**
- Specifications for the functions related to point 3 above. 
- 10 complex numbers already available at program startup.
